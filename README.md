# Employee-Tracker
## Description 
This backend application allows for a company to keep track of their employees positions, managers and salary. Keeping track of employees is an important part of bussiness management. Therefore, this application well resembles what a developer might have to create. Although it is only the back end, it could be paired with a front end HTML creator to make a full stack application that easily stores information into SQL. THe main mission of this project was for me to learn about the mysql commant that connect and filters the information between the mysql workbench and the javascript. Along with learning that, I was able to practice my ability with connecting functions, using prompts, and embedding information. 

## Usage
the usage of this app is very straight forward. it will prompt you with many options, which you can use to add, drop, replace, or view different pieces of the stored company data.
